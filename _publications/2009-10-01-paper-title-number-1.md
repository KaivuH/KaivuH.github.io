### Abstract

This paper considers the problem of helping humans exercise scalable oversight over deep neural networks (DNNs). Adversarial examples can be useful by helping to reveal weaknesses in DNNs, but they can be difficult to interpret or draw actionable conclusions from. Some previous works have proposed using human- interpretable adversarial attacks including copy/paste attacks in which one natural image pasted into another causes an unexpected misclassification. We build on these with two contributions. First, we introduce Search for Natural Adversarial Features Using Embeddings (SNAFUE) which offers a fully automated method for finding copy/paste attacks. Second, we use SNAFUE to red team an ImageNet classifier. We reproduce copy/paste attacks from previous works and find hundreds of other easily-describable vulnerabilities, all without a human in the loop.
